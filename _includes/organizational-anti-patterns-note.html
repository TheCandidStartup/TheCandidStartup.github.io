*This is part of a series describing Organizational [Anti-Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern). 
They are based on behaviors I've seen first hand, have heard from others or read about. They are **NOT** all about Autodesk. 
Those that are inspired by my time at Autodesk often reflect Autodesk as it was some years ago rather than as it is now.*
