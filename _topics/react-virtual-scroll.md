I've started coding again. For my first project, I've chosen to build yet another React virtual scrolling library. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheCandidStartup/infinisheet/tree/main/packages/react-virtual-scroll) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@candidstartup/react-virtual-scroll). 

Here's why and how I built it. For more context, check out my general [Front-End]({% link _topics/frontend.md %}) topic.
