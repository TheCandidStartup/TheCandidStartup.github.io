I've spent most of my life working on graphics engines and back-end systems in the cloud. The last serious front-end work I did was building an MFC UI for a Windows desktop application. Which was over 20 years ago. However, every back end needs a front end, so I need to be a full-stack developer. This is my journey to get up to speed with modern front-end development.

For a step by step look at building a modern React front-end package, check out my [React Virtual Scroll]({% link _topics/react-virtual-scroll.md %}) project.
