The Infinisheet apps all use react-spreadsheet for their main UI. This package contains a React component built on [react-virtual-scroll]({% link _topics/react-virtual-scroll.md %}) that implements the classic Spreadsheet UI we all know and love. The component retrieves the data needed to render the spreadsheet on demand, using the spreadsheet-data interface.
