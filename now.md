Back from a week's vacation in Scotland feeling refreshed and ready to go. Luckily I have something I completed earlier for this week's post.

[Last week]({% link _posts/2023-07-31-dynamodb-database-grid-view.md %}) I treated you to an in depth look at implementing a database backed Grid View with DynamoDB. [This week]({% link _posts/2023-08-07-spreadsheet-event-log.md %}) we segue back to my Spreadsheet series and look at how you might implement an event log using ... DynamoDB.

[Go to the Home Page]({{ '/' | absolute_url }})
