Now that I've nailed a weekly publishing cadence, I'll soon have more than 20 posts. Time for some quality time fiddling with the blog. Going to give the home page more of its own identity with just the most recent posts directly available, add pagination to the full list of posts and see what I can do in the way of tagging. 

[Go to the Home Page]({{ '/' | absolute_url }})
