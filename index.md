The Candid Startup is a home for my startup ideas, my writing about those ideas, and open source prototypes and implementations of those ideas.

You'll find a variety of content here. There could be deep thinking about industry trends and startup ideas, juicy gossip from my days at Autodesk or lab journal entries documenting my progress.
