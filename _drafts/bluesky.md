wise words
* Forced into it as people I follow on Twitter (now known as X) move over
* Keeping my twitter account for now for those still there

# Bluesky

* Sign up for account - email, password, DOB
* Weirdly no "email you a link" to validate your email address
* Create a username, whatever you want ending with .bsky.social - @thecandidstartup.bsky.social
* Complete a Captcha
* Upload a profile image
* Pick some interests
* Pick some followers

* You can optionally choose to verify your email in account settings
* Gives you a reassuring blue tick in the settings UI and apparently adds an extra layer of security as further changes need a confirmation code sent to the verified email address

# Website as username

* Clever "hack" (in the original sense of the term)
* Verification piggy backing on the domain name system
* If you can demonstrate that you control a domain, you can use that domain as your handle
* https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial
* Followed the instructions

* Added TXT record via my domain registrar. Click to copy host and value from Bluesky.
* Waited 5 minutes then pressed "Verify DNS Record"
* Reported domain verified and then another button to press to apply change
* Navigated back out to main settings page which showed that my handle was now "@thecandidstartup.bsky.social"
* On dear
* Refreshed web page and that sorted it
