  Organizational Anti-Patterns #2: The Old New Thing
---

At some point in your career all the stars will align. You're working on an exciting, groundbreaking new project. Even better everyone else in your organization thinks the same. They're falling over themselves to help out, remove blockers, get stuff done for you. The CEO calls out your project in the company all hands. It may just be the future of the organization.

Enjoy it. Make the most of it. It won't last. 

Maybe there was a reorg, an acquisition or a mandate that changed the environment. Maybe your project is taking a while to deliver results. Doesn't matter - for whatever reason the new hotness is here. And your project is now the *Old New Thing*. 

Becoming the Old New Thing is not an anti-pattern in and of itself. That's just human nature. The anti-pattern is in how the organization treats the Old New Thing. Here's a few things I've seen that you shouldn't do.

## The Leper

## Rewrite and Reimagine

## Acquire a Competitor

# Construction Software at Autodesk

My intention was to keep these articles very general and avoid calling out the guilty. However, in this case I have too good an example to pass up.

* Constructware - Leper
* Field and Glue - Adjacent space but no attempt to figure out how to make them work with Constructware. Only barely got them to work with each other. Rewrite with Navisworks engine.
* Next Gen BIM 360 - Rewrite from scratch
* PlanGrid - Acquire Competitor
* ACC - Rewrite more intelligently
* Forma - ???
