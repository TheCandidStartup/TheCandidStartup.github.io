title: AWS re:Invent 2022
---

I've only attended re:Invent in person once. I quickly realized that apart from the mountain of swag you get to bring home, there's very little advantage to being there in person. It's in Vegas. There are more than fifty thousand attendees. Do I need to say more? 

All the sessions are recorded with high quality audio/video and available via both the [AWS web site](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/amazonwebservices). Since then, I've cleared space in my diary in the week following re:Invent and settled down to watch the most interesting sessions at 1.5X speed. To save you the trouble of doing the same, here's my take on the most interesting sessions.

If you're looking for a comprehensive list of all the new announcements, then head over to the [AWS News Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/top-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2022/).
