[James Awe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-awe-4630a94/) was the first Software Architect I met at Autodesk. He was involved in the acquisition process for [Navisworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navisworks) where I was then CTO. Some years later he shared the story of how he first became aware of Navisworks. 

Jim was visting the team working on the design and engineering of [One World Trade Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center) (then known as the Freedom Tower). The Freedom Tower was a super high profile project and it was something of a coup for Autodesk that [they were using Revit](https://aecmag.com/news/bim-and-the-freedom-tower/) to design the building. Jim was there to see how Revit was used in practice on a big project and hopefully come away with a good news story of how Revit had made it all possible. 

As anyone who has worked on a large construction project knows, there is never just a single piece of software involved. Construction practices and processes evolve over time with a process of natural selection and survival of the fittest determining the software used for each task. As Jim continued his tour of the office he counted up over thirty different pieces of software in use on the project. 

"Are you really using all of these?", he asked his host. "We are", came the reply. "And out of all of them there's only two that we like". The first was [Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel) and the second was Navisworks.

They liked Excel and Navisworks because they just worked. They each focused on a specific task and did it well. They were easy to fit into the team's specific processes. They integrated well with the other software in use. 

Jim learned what he needed about how Revit was used in practice and as a bonus came away with a new acquisition target for Autodesk's M&A team.
