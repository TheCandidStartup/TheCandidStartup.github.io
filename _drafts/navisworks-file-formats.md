Recently, I've become aware of just how many different CAD/BIM design review file formats are out there. Autodesk has [Navisworks](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/NavisWorks-JetStream-file-formats-NWC-NWF-NWD-and-NWP.html) and [SVF](https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/svfsvf2-survey), and before that [DWF](https://help.autodesk.com/view/ACD/2022/ENU/?guid=GUID-DFC086F4-E98C-4FF7-A55E-67FC35007DE5). Bentley has [iModels](https://www.bentley.com/software/imodels/). There are lots of smaller third parties with their own formats. I'm thinking of things like [dotbim](https://dotbim.net/), [VIM](https://github.com/vimaec/vim-format), [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/) and [Resolve](https://blog.resolvebim.com/resolves-new-bim-engine-for-construction-vr/). And now, there's [lots of noise](https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en-gb/news/openusd/) around [OpenUSD](https://openusd.org/release/index.html) as the new do everything format for large scale 3D models.

I thought it might be interesting to have a look at a few of these formats in more detail. What makes them suitable for design review? Why do we need special formats at all? What's wrong with the native formats used to create the data in the first place? Why aren't we all using the [OpenBIM](https://www.buildingsmart.org/about/openbim/openbim-definition/) family of vendor neutral formats?

I created the Navisworks file formats, so it seems as good a place as any to start.
