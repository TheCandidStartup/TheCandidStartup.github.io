## DynamoDB Data Model

* Compound sort key
* Read charged by KB retrieved rather than per row

## Adjacency List Design Pattern

* Store all entities in the same table
* All rows have three common fields (PK, SK, Data) + whatever other attributes that entity needs
* Include a type identifying prefix in all ids
* Identify top level entities which you want to read/write individually
  * Add a row per entity with PK set to the entity id. If the entity has another field that you want to query by (acts as an alternative id) store that in SK. Otherwise also set SK to entity id.
  * Use Data to store any attribute that you want to be projected into the index
  * Tenant, Project, Issue
* For each top level entity identify reference relationships to other top level entities
  * Add a row per relationship
  * For one to many relationship set PK to entity id on the "one" side and SK to entity id on the many side.
    * Use Data to store any attribute or combination of attributes that you want to sort on in the index
  * For one to one relationship decide which entity is PK and which is SK depending on required access patterns
    * Use Data to store any attribute that you want to be projected into the index
  * Add any other attributes associated with the *relationship*. Could be unique or denormalized (copy of data in main entity row).
* For each top level entity identify containment relationships to sub-entities
  * Add a row for each contained sub-entity with PK set to containing entity id and SK to sub-entity id
  * Use Data to store any attribute or combination of attributes that you want to sort on in the index
  * Add other sub-entity specific attributes

## Sample Data

<!-- This is horrible. I want to style the table by highlighting alternating entities in the table (each entity can span multiple rows). I want to use the compact markdown table for the content. This is the only way I've found to add styling. There's no ids in the html generated by markdown so all I can target is the HTML tags themselves. Embedded style sheet applies to the entire page so I have to target a specific table and then row in the table. -->
<style type="text/css">
table:first-of-type tr:nth-child(2) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:first-of-type tr:nth-child(8) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:first-of-type tr:nth-child(12) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:first-of-type tr:nth-child(16) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}

table:nth-of-type(2) tr:nth-child(2) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:nth-of-type(2) tr:nth-child(6) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:nth-of-type(2) tr:nth-child(7) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:nth-of-type(2) tr:nth-child(10) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:nth-of-type(2) tr:nth-child(12) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
table:nth-of-type(2) tr:nth-child(13) {background-color:#f3f6fa;}
</style>
