  Organizational Anti-Patterns #3: Exceptions
---

There's a [VP move]({% link _posts/2022-10-31-organizational-anti-pattern-vp-moves.md %}) under way. A company wide mandate has been issued. Big changes are coming. What's your immediate reaction? Are you excited? Ready for the challenge? Or is you first thought to wonder how you can get an exception?

Exceptions are a common antibody against excessive use of VP mandates. The usual form of exception is to defer something with a deadline to a later date. Perhaps you have a customer commitment that you need to meet first, or maybe most of the team are out on vacation at the same time. Where's the harm in a short, pragmatic extension of the deadline?

No harm at all, perfectly reasonable. Unfortunately,  when the new deadline comes around there's another perfectly valid reason why you need to extend again. Somehow whatever it was keeps being put off until the VP responsible has got bored and moved onto something else. 

* First encounter with an exception culture - corrosive, feel like a fool for going along with it. Eventually end up in a world where nothing is taken at face value - relying on scuttlebutt and gossip to figure out which initiatives are really going to happen. Fast follower.
* Full blown exception culture when everyone's reaction to any mandate is how do I get an exception? Everybody going through the form filling exercise of logging and extending exceptions even though everyone knows they will never happen. VP effectiveness is a function of how good they are at getting exceptions for mandates sponsored by other VPs compared with how well they resist other VPs getting exceptions to their mandates.
* The madness of security exceptions.
