# Code Coverage

* More choices. v8 vs istanbul.
* v8 uses the [built in code coverage measurement](https://v8.dev/blog/javascript-code-coverage) in the Chrome v8 engine. It uses a combination of metrics that v8 already collects together with additional block level instrumentation in the generated byte code.
* Istanbul is a long standing JavaScript test coverage tool. It works by instrumenting your JavaScript source code with line counters.
* So which is best? It depends. Doesn't seem to be a clear cut consensus. Your mileage may vary.
