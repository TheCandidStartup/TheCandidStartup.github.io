wise words

* When typing text into Excel, the input is parsed to try and determine the format. The end result is that both value and format are set for the cell.
* If you type into a cell with a pure text format, the string is [left as is](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/stop-automatically-changing-numbers-to-dates-452bd2db-cc96-47d1-81e4-72cec11c4ed8).
* Not clear if there are special cases when typing into cells with other kinds of format already applied.
* From StackOverflow questions it looks like Excel will parse general date input and set value and format regardless of any existing format.
