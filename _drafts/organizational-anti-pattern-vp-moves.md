  Organizational Anti-Patterns #1: VP Moves
---

Paradoxically, the higher up an organization you go, the less direct influence you have on what happens at the coal face. 

I'm going to use "VP" as short hand for those leaders at the top of an organization, e.g. C-Level or those that report to them.

At the VP level there's not many levers you can pull to significantly change the direction of the organization. At this point people usually pull out the supertanker analogy - you need a really large input to get it to change direction.
