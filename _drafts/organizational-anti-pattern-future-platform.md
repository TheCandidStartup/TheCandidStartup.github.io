Let's say you work for a large organization that, for [whatever]({{vp_url | strip | append: "#the-acquisition"}}) [reason]({{ ont_url | strip | append: "#competition" }}), has a lot of duplicate development. Pick any kind of project you can think of and, if you look hard enough, you'll find five different teams working on their own version. Almost inevitably, at some point, a VP will decide that the solution to this recurring problem is to build *The Future Platform*. 

{% include organizational-anti-patterns-note.html %}

"If only we had a common platform there would be no need for all this pointless duplication. Teams would be more productive. They could focus on delivering business value rather than doing undifferentiated heavy lifting. We can bake in company policy so that teams will automatically do the right thing."

"Sounds great. How do we get started? All the product teams are fully loaded working on customer commitments and sales blockers."

"No problem, we'll set up a platform group to build it. They can take the time to figure out what we really need without being constrained by all these short term requirements. They can look ahead and build the future platform we're eventually going to need. After all, we [want to skate to where the puck is going](https://archive.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/stop-using-gretzky-where-the-puck-is-quote/)."

What could go wrong?

# It's Not the Technology

The biggest problem is the assumption that a common platform will prevent duplicate effort. This is the classic mistake of trying to solve an organizational problem with technology. Teams build their own version of something that already exists because
* They don't know that it already exists (your organization has a communication problem)
* They know that it exists but they can't use it because its written in the wrong language or built on the wrong stack (your organization lacks a strong common culture)
* They know that something exists, built in the right language on the right stack, but they don't trust the team that maintains it (your organization has conflicting priorities)

# Conflicting Priorities

We need to unpack that last point further. Why would a team rather build their own version of something that already exists in a usable form? 

Because they've been burnt before.

# The Platform Bottleneck

# The Inner-Platform Effect
