  Organizational Anti-Patterns #7: Product Managers
tags: org-anti-patterns
---

Obviously, I'm not suggesting that the entire role of Product Manager is an anti-pattern. Somebody has to [identify customer needs, understand business objectives and articulate what success looks like](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/product-manager). The [Harvard Business Review says](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager) that great product managers need highly developed emotional intelligence to forge connections with internal and external stakeholders, and to sway them to their point of view. Not usually a core competency for more engineering focused roles.

However, With great emotional intelligence, comes great responsibility. Product Manager is such a critical role that any imbalance in the PM's skills or division of responsibilities with other roles can give rise to a wide selection of entertaining anti-patterns.
