  Organizational Anti-Patterns #7: Product Managers
tags: org-anti-patterns
---

Obviously, I'm not suggesting that the entire role of Product Manager is an anti-pattern. Somebody has to [identify customer needs, understand business objectives and articulate what success looks like](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/product-manager). The [Harvard Business Review says](https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager) that great product managers need highly developed emotional intelligence to forge connections with internal and external stakeholders, and to sway them to their point of view. Not usually a core competency for more engineering focused roles.

However, with great emotional intelligence, comes great responsibility. Product Manager is such a critical role that any imbalance in the PM's skills or division of responsibilities with other roles can give rise to a wide selection of entertaining anti-patterns.

## The Non-technical Product Manager

"Hi! I'm Robin[^1], the new Product Manager. I expect we'll be working closely together. I'm not technical".

[^1]: Not their real name.

My heart sank. I worked for a technology company. Our product used cutting edge technology. We had a wide range of users, but our power users were amongst the most technical in their industry. Robin might as well have introduced themselves by saying, "Hi! I'm incompetent!"

### Yeah but No but Yeah

Non-technical PMs have no understanding of how things work under the hood. In turn, they have no idea of what might be hard or easy to implement. They have no conception of whether what they're proposing is brilliant or bonkers. When you work with a non-technical PM you'll spend a lot of time responding to proposals for product features that make no sense technically. It's critical that you learn how to respond correctly.

Typically, software architects and engineers are problem solvers. We like to find solutions. You will naturally find yourself responding, "Yes, we could do that but here's a long list of technical reasons why that isn't such a great idea".

"Great! Let's do it", says the PM.

You're left spluttering as they stride off, mission accomplished. Didn't they hear what you said? 

What they actually heard was, "Yes ... blah blah ... techno-babble ... blah blah blah".

The one stupid trick you need to learn is to respond, "No, we can't do that and here's a long list of technical reasons why we can't".

### Where's the button?

Non-technical PMs have no understanding of how things work under the hood. The corollary being that any work done under the hood seems pointless to them. Building out APIs, upgrading old components, addressing technical debt? All useless engineering gold plating. 

Be prepared for endless battles about prioritization of any work that doesn't result in some clear and obvious change to the UI.
