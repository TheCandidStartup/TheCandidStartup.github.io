title: Bootstrapping Storybook
tags: frontend
---

[Last time]({% link _posts/2025-01-06-component-test-playwright-vitest.md %}), we had a look at Vitest browser mode and Playwright component testing. I was looking for a tool to help with component and integration testing of my React components. 

Neither worked well enough to convince me. In both cases you needed to write a significant amount of wrapper code to make components testable. About the same amount of code as a simple standalone sample app. In both cases the developer experience was worse than using Playwright to test a sample app. 

What if there was a way to write that component wrapper code once and have it automatically integrated into an app that's a combination of sample app, interactive documentation and component test fixture?

# Storybook

[Storybook]() describes itself as a "frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation". Teams use it for UI development, testing and documentation.

Storybook generates an app that showcases your components. Each component has its own page with embedded documentation and controls that allow you to modify component props and interact with the component. Different component states can be saved as [stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/whats-a-story). Each story has a corresponding page in the app. 

Stories are defined using [Component Story Format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/csf). CSF is simply an ES6 module, written in JavaScript or TypeScript, that exports `Story` objects and component metadata. 

CSF is portable, allowing stories to be integrated with a variety of [design](https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/design-integrations) and [testing](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests) tools.

# Installation

As with Playwright, there's [little detail](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/install) on installation and configuration, just a command to run "inside your project's root directory". Once that's done, it promises to launch a setup wizard to take you through an onboarding experience.

There's nothing in the documentation about monorepos. However, I did find this [discussion](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/22521) of different ways to setup Storybook in a monorepo.

The simplest approach is to run the default setup in the root of the monorepo. There are various downsides described that mean this isn't the best long term solution. It does seem like the easiest way to kick the tyres and see if I want to go further.

```

    We couldn't detect your project type. (code: UNDETECTED)
    You can specify a project type explicitly via `storybook init --type <type>`, see our docs on how to configure Storybook for your framework: https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/install

âœ” Do you want to manually choose a Storybook project type to install? â€¦ yes
```

I'm running this in the root of a monorepo, so not surprising that there's nothing in `package.json` for the installer to go on. I thought it would just be a case of picking `react` from a list of frameworks. 

There's a long list of choices including `react`, `react_scripts`, `react_native`, `react_project` and `webpack_react`. There's nothing in the Storybook documentation to explain the differences. The best thing I could find was a [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71074658/whats-the-difference-react-vs-react-project-vs-webpack-react-for-storybook) which suggests the difference is in what dependencies are added to `package.json`.

I can fix up the dependencies easily enough if wrong, so went with `react`.

```

I checked the changes made to `package.json` and didn't see anything too weird. This is the monorepo root `package.json` so only contains dev dependencies. 

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
    "build-storybook": "storybook build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@chromatic-com/storybook": "^3.2.3",
    "@storybook/addon-essentials": "^8.4.7",

  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "plugin:storybook/recommended"
    ]
  }
}
```

I'll integrate the eslint config into my main eslint config later. As well as installing Storybook, the setup script adds some configuration files in `.storybook` and a complete set of example components and stories in `stories`.

```ts
import type { StorybookConfig } from "@storybook/react-vite";

import { join, dirname } from "path";

/**
 * This function is used to resolve the absolute path of a package.
 * It is needed in projects that use Yarn PnP or are set up within a monorepo.
 */
function getAbsolutePath(value: string): any {
  return dirname(require.resolve(join(value, "package.json")));
}
const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: [
    "../stories/**/*.mdx",
    "../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)",
  ],
  addons: [
    getAbsolutePath("@storybook/addon-onboarding"),
    getAbsolutePath("@storybook/addon-essentials"),
    getAbsolutePath("@chromatic-com/storybook"),
    getAbsolutePath("@storybook/addon-interactions"),
  ],
  framework: {
    name: getAbsolutePath("@storybook/react-vite"),
    options: {},
  },
};
export default config;
```

The setup process has detected that I'm using Vite and has included some sort of magic to handle the case where Storybook is installed in a nested directory within a monorepo. 

Setup ends by running the dev server with the example stories.

{% include candid-image.html src="/assets/images/frontend/storybook-example.png" alt="Storybook Dev Server with example project" %}

I was looking forward to experiencing the setup wizard but it didn't appear for me. I was able to trigger it manually by changing the URL in the browser to `http://localhost:6006/?path=onboarding`. It uses large tooltips to guide you through the process of changing the Props for an example button control and saving it as a new story. 

Then you get to see some lovely animated fireworks.

# First Story

I added `../packages/*/src/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)` to the `stories` key in the config file. The recommended practice is to put stories next to the corresponding component source file. I copied one of the example stories to `VirtualList.stories.tsx` and started hacking.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { fn } from '@storybook/test';

import { VirtualList } from './VirtualList';
import { useVariableSizeItemOffsetMapping } from './useVariableSizeItemOffsetMapping';

const mapping = useVariableSizeItemOffsetMapping(30, [50]);

const meta = {
  title: 'react-virtual-scroll/VirtualList',
  component: VirtualList,
  parameters: {
    layout: 'centered',
  },
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  argTypes: {
  },
  // Use `fn` to spy on the onScroll arg, which will appear in the actions panel once invoked
  args: { onScroll: fn() },
} satisfies Meta<typeof VirtualList>;

export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;

const Row = ({ index, style }: { index: number, style: React.CSSProperties }) => (
  <div className={ index == 0 ? "header" : "cell" } style={style}>
    { (index == 0) ? "Header" : "Item " + index }
  </div>
);

export const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    children: Row,
    itemCount: 100,
    itemOffsetMapping: mapping,
    width: 600,
    height: 240,
  },
};
```

In CSF each module has one required [default export](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/csf#default-export) and one or more [named exports](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/csf#named-story-exports). The default export, usually named meta, defines metadata for a component which controls how the the component appears inside Storybook. Each named export is a story that represents an interesting state of the component. The simplest story is a list of `args` which are passed as props to your component. 

There's quite a lot of boiler plate to write. As it's a self contained ES6 module, you have to import all your dependencies explicitly, including Storybook APIs and types as well as your component. You'll need to provide reasonable values for any required props. Complex props may pull in additional dependencies. 

My `VirtualList` component requires a child React component and an implementation of a mapping interface. The resulting story is actually more verbose than the corresponding standalone sample app.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { VirtualList, useVariableSizeItemOffsetMapping } from '@candidstartup/react-virtual-scroll';

const Row = ({ index, style }: { index: number, style: React.CSSProperties }) => (
  <div className={ index == 0 ? "header" : "cell" } style={style}>
    { (index == 0) ? "Header" : "Item " + index }
  </div>
);

function App() {
  const mapping = useVariableSizeItemOffsetMapping(30, [50]);

  return (
    <VirtualList
      height={240}
      itemCount={100}
      itemOffsetMapping={mapping}
      width={600}>
      {Row}
    </VirtualList>
  )
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(<App />);
```

However, you do get a lot for your money once you fire up Storybook. 

{% include candid-image.html src="/assets/images/frontend/storybook-first-story.png" alt="VirtualList story as it appears in Storybook" %}

What do you know, it worked first time.

Storybook has picked up my new story and included my component. There's auto-generated interactive documentation using my [TSDoc]({% link _posts/2024-07-08-bootstrapping-tsdoc.md %}) comments. It hasn't done a perfect job - there's a few tags it doesn't understand.

You can view the current value of all props, even the complex ones, and change them. When you scroll the list, the values passed to the `onScroll` callback are recorded in the actions tab.

I'd need an awful lot more code in the sample app to achieve a fraction of this.

* Seems to have worked. I tried opening the generated `index.html` directly in the browser. Nothing displayed.
* The Storybook [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/publish-storybook#build-storybook-as-a-static-web-application) suggests using `http-server` to preview locally.

```

```

* That worked. Looks and behaves just like the dev server.
* There are instructions on how to [deploy the built app using GitHub Pages](https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/publish-storybook#github-pages) which would allow me to include the Storybook as part of my online documentation. 
* No obvious option for specifying the base path that static app will be served from (cf Vite option). There's a Storybook [discussion](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/17433) that suggests you can [dynamically adjust the Vite config](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/main-config/main-config-vite-final) that Storybook uses to build. 

# Component Testing

My main reason for looking at Storybook was to find a good solution for component and integration testing. Storybook supports a range of testing functionality.

Storybook has [direct support](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/component-testing) for basic component tests. Each story can include a [`play`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/play-function) function which can interact with the component and check assertions. There's one play function per story, so not designed for an extensive test suite. 

The play function is executed and the assertions checked when you look at a story in the Storybook UI. You can also use the [test-runner](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/component-testing#execute-tests-with-the-test-runner) command line utility to run all tests for you. 

I think it makes more sense to think of the play function as a way to put the component into a particular state. For example, I might want to create stories that show my `VirtualSpreadsheet` component with row, column and cell selected. The easiest way to achieve that is to interact with the component and click on the appropriate element. 

Storybook has utilities that allow you to [import and run stories in Vitest](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/import-stories-in-tests/stories-in-unit-tests). That might be useful for basic validation of story logic but isn't what I'm looking for.

The simplest approach is to use [Playwright to interact with your Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/import-stories-in-tests/stories-in-end-to-end-tests#with-playwright). 

* Each story has a dedicated URL, e.g. `http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/react-virtual-scroll-virtuallist--default`
* The page hosts your component within an iframe
* You can locate the component within the page using `page.locator('iframe[title="storybook-preview-iframe"]').contentFrame()` then chain on whatever locator you want within the page.
* Interact with arg controls as part of the test using `page.locator('#control-itemCount')`
* Alternatively you can use a URL that contains just the control (the content of the iframe) and interact with it directly `http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=react-virtual-scroll-virtuallist--default`
* You can create multiple stories as starting points for tests or [override the args](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/args#setting-args-through-the-url) of existing stories in the URL `http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/react-virtual-scroll-virtuallist--docs&args=itemCount:200` or `http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?id=react-virtual-scroll-virtuallist--default&args=itemCount:200`

# Black Box Testing

* This all looks great but there's a problem
* Component and integration tests should treat the component as a black box, interacting entirely through the public interface
* Storybook prioritizes ease of setup and encourages intrusive integration
* Stories are placed next to the corresponding component's source code
* Stories use relative imports not package imports
* The Storybook app uses a custom build process that directly includes component source code rather than using the build packages
* I could have libraries that pass all units, component and integration tests while being unusable because I've forgotten to export something vital

# Storybook as a monorepo app

* The consensus from the Storybook monorepo [discussion](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/22521) is that Storybook should be setup as just another app in the monorepo.
* There are lots of benefits from doing it this way
  * Get rid of the special case extra directories in the monorepo root
  * Storybook config and source code (stories) become part of a dedicated Storybook app
  * Use `dev` and `build` scripts like any other app rather than special Storybook magic
  * Stories import component packages using the public interface like any other app
  * Clean separation of Storybook dependencies from those for other apps and packages
  * Option to have multiple Storybook apps if you need different configurations. For example, if you have components that use other frameworks.
* First remove all the sample stories to get down to a minimal set of files to muck around with
* Setup a basic app skeleton by copying and pasting from my existing `spreadsheet-sample` app
* The Storybook [Vite builder](https://storybook.js.org/docs/builders/vite) uses the project's existing Vite config file by default so hopefully should just work
* Moved the `.storybook` config directory from root to `apps/storybook/.storybook`
* Moved `VirtualList.stories.tsx` from `packages/react-virtual-scroll/src` to `apps/storybook/src`
* Updated `.storybook/main.ts` to look for stories in `../src` rather than `../stories` or directly in packages
* Changed the story to import from `@candidstartup/react-virtual-scroll`
* Updated `package.json` 

```json
{
  "name": "@candidstartup/storybook",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.6.2",
  "type": "module",
  "files": [
    "dist"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "storybook dev -p 6006",
    "build": "storybook build -o dist",
    "preview": "vite preview --port 6006",
    "playwright": "npx playwright test",
    "lint": "eslint . --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@candidstartup/react-virtual-scroll": "^0.6.2",
    "@candidstartup/react-spreadsheet": "^0.6.2",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

* Changed the name to storybook, added storybook scripts for `dev` and `build`
* My first attempt at this missed off the `@candidstartup` scope qualifier. Everything worked fine until I checked it in and CI failed running `npm ci` with an unintelligible multi-page dependency error. After an hour tearing my hair out I eventually found that npm writes an `eresolve-report.txt` file into the npm logs directory which tells you exactly what the problem is. No idea why it doesn't output it to the terminal. Obviously, npm is going to get confused by a dependency tree that includes both my private app package called "storybook" and the main Storybook package also called "storybook". 
* Changed the output directory for build to the standard `dist` from default of `storybook-static`.
* Removed `storybook-static` from my .gitignore
* Added my dependencies for the build and left it to Storybook to add whatever it needed at build time
* Left the copied `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json` config files as is
* To my surprise the dev and build scripts worked first time
* I tried running `vite preview` and it happily worked with the build output that Storybook put in `dist`. No need for `http-server`.
* Using the standard Storybook port of `6006` for both dev and preview. Avoid potential conflict with other apps. Using same port for dev and preview makes it easy to run Playwright tests against both.
* Storybook actually works too well. It picks up and uses the TypeScript path alias definition in my `tsconfig.json` for both development and production builds. This is the definition that allows package imports like `@candidstartup/react-virtual-scroll` to be resolved against the source code in the monorepo. This gives a great development experience but you don't want it to happen for production builds. For true component testing you want the production build to consume the built packages via `node_modules`. 
* This happens by default for normal Vite production builds because Vite uses it's own internal `tsconfig`. This doesn't have the path alias or the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin that allows Vite to make use of the alias.
* I initially tried to configure Storybook to use my `tsconfig.build.json` config file rather than `tsconfig.json` but couldn't find an option for that.
* Storybook does provide a way to tweak the final merged Vite configuration using the Storybook `viteFinal` [config option](https://storybook.js.org/docs/builders/vite#configuration). That allows me to remove the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin from `vite.config.ts` and then add it conditionally for development builds in `viteFinal`.

```ts
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  ...,
  async viteFinal(config, { configType }) { 
    const { mergeConfig } = await import("vite");

    if (configType === 'PRODUCTION')
      return config;

    return mergeConfig(config, {
      plugins: [ tsconfigPaths() ]
    })
  }
};
```

# Playwright Test

* I added `VirtualList.spec.ts` containing the simplest possible Playwright test

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });

test('Control loads', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/iframe.html?id=react-virtual-scroll-virtuallist--default');
  const header = page.getByText('Header');
  await expect(header).toBeInViewport();
});
```

* It loads the isolated version of the control, looks for the first item in the list and confirms that it's in the viewport
* I copied `playwright.config.ts` from my spreadsheet sample app and updated it to work with Storybook

```ts
{
  webServer: {
     command: (process.env.CI || process.env.PROD) ? 'npm run preview' : 'npm run dev',
     url: 'http://localhost:6006/',
     reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI
  }
}
```

* I use the production build when in a CI environment and default to the dev version otherwise
* I added a check on my own environment variable so I can force use of the production build locally for final testing, without activating all the other CI specific behavior. Use it like this: `PROD=true npx lerna run playwright`
* I tried to run the test using the Playwright VS Code extension, but found that only the spreadsheet sample app test had been loaded
* It turns out that by default the extension only loads tests for the first config file it finds
* You can choose which config file to use via a dropdown in the UI

{% include candid-image.html src="/assets/images/frontend/playwright-vscode-multiple-configs.png" alt="Playwright VSCode Extension with multiple configs" %}

* If you click on the icon next to the drop down you can multi-select configs so that all tests are loaded. No idea why this isn't the default.

# ESLint

* Last, and most time consuming, step was setting up eslint to use the storybook plugin
* Removed the old style eslint config that `storybook init` added to the root `package.json`
* Edited the storybook app stub `eslint.config.mjs` to merge in the Storybook eslint config

```ts
import configs from "../../eslint.config.mjs";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";
import storybook from "eslint-plugin-storybook";

export default tseslint.config(
  ...configs,
  ...storybook.configs['flat/recommended'],
  { ignores: [ ".storybook" ] },
);
```

* Same as every time I touch the new eslint flat config, wasn't straight forward to get it working
* After a few false starts did what I should have done in the first place and read the instructions that [come with the plugin](https://github.com/storybookjs/eslint-plugin-storybook)
* As previously, ignored the config files when linting to avoid warnings about tsconfig not including them

# Next Time

* Add stories for each component, add some CSS for basic styling, flesh out the Playwright tests
