wise words

* 110L MiniStore Tall for hot water as minimal room in airing cupboard where boiler lives

{% include candid-image.html src="/assets/images/home-assistant/airing-cupboard.jpg" alt="Airing Cupboard" %}

* MiniStore is small cylinder plumbed in reverse to act as a heat store / "combi"

* NanoStore guinea pigs
  * Offer from Heat Geek to be one of the first NanoStore installs
  * Plate heat exchanger - see Heat Geek video
  * [Nordic Tec BA-115-100](https://nordictec-store.com/ba-115-serie-0115mplate-2-thread-/323-plate-heat-exchanger-nordic-ba-115-100-2-3400kw.html) plate heat exchanger
  * Rather than using water as heat store, use metal body of heat exchanger
  * More compact, much better energy transfer
  * Two ESBE VTA 370/570 series thermostatic mixing valves, 20-55 degrees range, adjustment knob to select temperature from 1 to 6.
  * One to reduce hot water from the heat exchanger to safe temperature
  * Other plumbed in reverse to act as a diverting valve so that water flowing from the heat pump only goes into the heat exchanger when it's reached a suitable temperature.
  * Discount, free open energy monitoring and guarantee to replace with MiniStore if it didn't work for us

* Heat Exchanger much bigger than the one in the video. Based on the external dimensions looks like a [BA-115-170](https://nordictec-store.com/ba-115-serie-0115mplate-2-thread-/1472-plate-heat-exchanger-nordic-ba-115-170-25-6300kw.html). Weighs over 100 Kg so very difficult for two people to maneuver up the stairs and into a narrow cupboard.
* According to Nordic Tec website it's a "large industrial plate heat exchanger" with "significant weight" that is "not a heat exchanger for single-family homes".
* Of course Heat Geek aren't using it in a typical way. Needs to be big enough to act as a heat store for the time it takes for the heat pump to react and build up to full power.
* NanoStore is all about combi-like operation. Water has eight times the heat capacity of steel, so a 110L MiniStore can store much more heat than a 100Kg NanoStore. NanoStore is much better at transferring the heat generated by the heat pump, once it starts running. 
* Assume the one we've got is so much bigger because we have two showers and they want to see whether both can be used simultaneously. Plus installing a range of sizes gives them more data to work out the optimal size for future installs.
* Heat exchanger plus [open energy monitoring level 3](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/level-3-heat-pump-monitoring-bundle-emonhp/) is Â£3000 worth of kit, at list prices, so we got a good deal for being guinea pigs.

* Thermal Siphoning
* First proper test on Saturday
* Tail end of Storm Amy, much colder day. Never above 10 degrees, mostly around 8.
* Heat pump running but only for DHW cycles, every 60-90 minutes. No heating cycle at all. 
* Messaged Damon who replied almost instantly. Suggested bumping heat curve right up to 2.2 to give 55 degree flow temp, to force heating to kick in.
* After a long drawn out few minutes it finally kicked in. Took an hour to get house up to temperature. I went back to design heat curve of 0.7.
* House stayed at temperature but behavior was the same. A DHW cycle every 60-90 minutes. No heating cycle. COP around 2.5.

This is an annotated history graph from Home Assistant. The blue line shows the reported hot water temperature and heat pump flow temperature. The blue shading shows when the heat pump is generating heat with the hot water circuit active. The red shading shows when it's generating heat with the heating circuit active. The rest of the time water is being pumped round the heating circuit but the heat pump isn't generating heat.
* Reasonable COP around 5
* At minimum level heat pump kicks out 3 kW of heat using 600 W of electricity. With a temperature delta of 7 degrees, heat pump was on 50% of the time. Cycle it settled at was 45 minutes on, 45 minutes off. Can tweak the energy integral threshold for starting a new cycle to change cycle length. May try increasing it to see how much more efficient a longer cycle is (and whether it makes room temperature oscillate too much).

* Energy integral never got low enough for heating cycle to start before next DHW cycle.
* Target flow temperature was around 25 degrees and actual flow temperature was about that or higher most of the time
* Where was the heat coming from? Given rapid loss of heat from heat exchanger (without airing cupboard or outside of insulation feeling over warm) seemed most likely that it was escaping into the heating circuit.
* Almost at the same time got a message from Damon saying it was most likely to be thermal siphoning which would need to be fixed by adding no-return check valves to the installation. 
* Turned off the hot water. We can heat on demand when we need it and use immediately.
* Normal heating cycle kicked in after a couple of hours.
* Damon messaged again the following day. Whole team were heading out for a remote week long job but would send one of them back a day early so they can fit the valves on Friday. Also offered to cover my electricity costs until problem sorted.
* Rearranged again to the following Monday
* Belt and braces approach with four check valves. Two spring loaded ones on the inflows and two flutter valves on the outflows.

* Took an afternoon to do. Needed to alter some of the pipework runs to get long enough straight sections to fit the valves in
* Fired everything up, turned on hot water and heating, crossed fingers.

# Blending Valves

{% include candid-image.html src="/assets/images/home-assistant/esbe-vta372-mixing-valve.png" alt="ESBE VTA 370/570 series mixing valves" %}

* Initially hot water blending valve was on max
* Hot water came out scalding and then reduced linearly
* Turned down to 4.5 which seems to be about 45 degrees at the valve, 41 or so at the tap
* Don't know what heat pump diverting valve was initially set to

{% include candid-image.html src="/assets/images/home-assistant/divert-valve-min.png" alt="DHW cycle with min setting for divert valve" %}

* DHW: 0.669kWh consumed, 1.096 generated, COP 1.64. Post heat dump: 1.029 kWh

{% include candid-image.html src="/assets/images/home-assistant/divert-valve-max.png" alt="DHW cycle with max setting (3 visible) for divert valve" %}

* DHW: 0.589kWh consumed, 0.458 generated, COP 0.78. Post heat dump: 1.159 kWh

* Valve not stable! Same valve settings, 10 degree difference in when it starts charging NanoStore.
* Annotated with tank temperature in yellow. Very coarse grained, samples received by Home Assistant at 5 minute intervals. myVaillant has very low API quotas.
* Sensor near cold water inlet so can quickly respond to water draw. However, not representative of temperature at hot water outlet, at heat pump inlet or what the current "stored" temperature is. 
* Suspect some correlation between temperature at valve "cold inlet" (connected to NanoStore heat pump inlet) and temperature needed at "hot inlet" (connected to heat pump return flow) for valve to open.
