title: AlphaESS Smile 5 Home Battery Storage System

I've wanted to get a home battery storage system for a while. We had solar panels installed back in 2009. On a sunny day I could see that we were generating much more electricity than we needed. The excess power is exported to the grid for a laughably low rate. Then when the sun goes down I can buy the power back from the grid at an extortionately high rate. 

I first became aware of home battery storage systems when the [Tesla Powerwall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Powerwall) went into mainstream production in 2016. Prices were too high to justify the expense and the idea stayed on the back burner.

It took three changes in circumstances to finally kick me into action. First, we got an electric car and a specialist electricity tariff to go with it. The [Octopus Go](https://octopus.energy/smart/go/) tariff offered a four hour period overnight with electricity at 5p per kWh, compared with 18p during the rest of the day. The idea was that you would charge your car overnight during the cheap period. Of course anything else using electricity at that time would be cheap too. You could charge a home battery overnight at cheap rates and then discharge it during the day. 

Second, the energy crisis hit. Electricity prices increased massively. Our tariff increased to 44p during the day but was only 7.5p overnight. There was no sign of the increases stabilizing. There was even talk of rolling blackouts during the winter. The economics of a home battery were looking increasingly attractive. 

Third, I was retiring. Suddenly, I had a lot more time on my hands for personal projects.

## Supply Constraints

Unsurprisingly, it seems like lots of people had the same idea. I had great difficulty finding an installer who would even bother to return my calls. When I did find one, I was told there was a six month waiting list. I booked my place in the queue with [Oval Renewables](https://ovalrenewables.com/) and settled down to wait.

At least I could use the time to do some research and decide which storage system to go for. It turns out I wasted my time. As well as a shortage of installers, there was also a shortage of batteries to install. There was the increased demand, but also reduced supply due to the after effects of the pandemic. In the end once we factored in what would fit in the limited space we had available and what the installer could get their hands on, there was a choice of one.

## Initial Quote

After repeated nudging, we got close enough to the front of the queue to get a quote. I was emailed a questionnaire to fill in. At this point I was unsure what I wanted. Did I just want to add a battery to our existing system or increase our solar capacity at the same time? I asked for a quote with separate estimates for the battery and a couple of different options for increasing the solar capacity. 

After reviewing the quotes, increasing the solar was a non-starter. The only option they could offer was replacing our existing panels with more efficient modern ones. However, the cost and disruption simply wasn't worth the 20% increase in capacity. The existing panels work as well as they did when first installed. Seems awfully wasteful to rip them out and throw them away.

The battery quote seemed reasonable and I confirmed that I wanted to go ahead.

## Survey

I reached the front of the queue in December 2022. Oval contacted me and booked us in for a survey. The only place with any space was our utility room. This is a small room (2mx1m) off the kitchen that we use as a dumping ground for recycling bins, a shoe rack, running/walking/cycling gear and the cat's litter tray.
