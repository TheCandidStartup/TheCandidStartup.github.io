title: A Career in Business Cards

I have a lot of business cards. Every significant change in my career was accompanied with a new set of business cards. Business cards come in sets of 500 or 1000. I used at most 50 out of any set, which means I have lots left over. I've used them to play games when the kids were young, to scribble notes on, as cue cards when public speaking. 

Business cards are fascinating historical artifacts. Each a snapshot of a moment in time. The graphical design that takes you straight back to that decade. The job title you only vaguely remember having. The way that each business card comes from the beginning of my career with each company. After all, I have hundreds of the things, why bother replacing them just because my job title changed.

So, here's my career viewed through the medium of business cards.

## Cambridge University

We start with an anticlimax. I spend three years as an undergraduate at Cambridge University, followed by another three as a graduate student in the Computer Graphics research group. I wasn't one of those sad people in the Enterprise Society that had business cards.

One day, while writing up my thesis, I saw a job advert on the departmental noticeboard. They were looking for a post-doctoral researcher with computer graphics experience. 

## The Martin Centre

The Martin Centre was my first proper job (well as close as you can get to a proper job in academia) and my first business card. I like the generally understated design (apart from the ridiculous number of different fonts). The Martin Centre was the post graduate research wing of the Architecture department (buildings rather than software). The logo is based on early work on geometric form. The outline square on the left represents a courtyard, the square on the right a tower block. Perhaps surprisingly, both have the same floor area.

Simon Schofield and I were hired by Paul Richens, the director of the centre. Paul had secured a grant for a computer laboratory with the open ended remit to do something interesting in the field of computers and architecture. I worked on a variety of 3D graphics projects including one of the first interactive solid modellers and large model viewing. Simon had an art and multimedia background and worked on a 3D painting tool that was commercialized as [Piranesi](https://www.piranesi.co.uk/index.html). 

We had lots of visitors from industry, one of whom was a director of LightWork Design, a graphics software company based in Sheffield. He was looking for potential new products and liked the look of the large model viewing demo. By this time I'd been at the Martin Centre for five years and was getting tired of academia. When LightWork Design licensed the large model viewing technology, I went with it.
