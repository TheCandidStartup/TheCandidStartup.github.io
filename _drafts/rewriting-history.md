wise words

* This is a blog, not a set of living documents, so each post is meant to represent a moment in time
* What to do if I want to change something later?
* If I spot a typo or broken link, I'll just fix it without thinking about it
* If I see a simple factual error that was also an error at the time I wrote the blog, and it's a simple one liner kind of change, I'll fix that too.
* If I have additional information I'll add a comment.

* There's one class of posts where these simple approaches don't work.
* More of the problem for how-to type posts. These are the ones that get most traffic from Google. Someone with a problem, I've got an answer and they'll read just far enough to solve their problem. 
* If I realize that a post is outdated enough to be dangerous, I'll add a highlighted note at the top listing the issues.
* If I'm interested enough to rewrite the post for modern times, I'll leave the existing post in place for posterity and the Google search index, with a note at the top redirecting users to the latest version. 
* Rewritten posts will also have a disclaimer at the top listing the reasons for the rewrite and a link to the old version.
* First post I'm rewriting is [Vitest Monorepo Setup]({% link _posts/2024-08-19-vitest-monorepo-setup.md %}), which is my second most popular page for visitors from Google Search. Reader [christoph-hue](https://github.com/christoph-hue) left a [comment](https://github.com/TheCandidStartup/TheCandidStartup.github.io/issues/42#issuecomment-3193623479) (thank you!), pointing out that my recommendations were deprecated as of Vitest 3.2.
