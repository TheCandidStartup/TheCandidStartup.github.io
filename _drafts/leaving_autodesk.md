title: The Seven Reasons why I REALLY left Autodesk
---

When I announced my retirement I included this explanation :

> Some of you may be wondering why I’m retiring now. Autodesk and ACS remains the same Smart, Innovative, Adaptable, Inclusive, Impactful, Humble, Courageous, 
> Accountable and Pragmatic company that it has always been (see what I did there?). It’s been a pleasure to work here and I would gladly recommend a career at

All of which is true but incomplete. So, in true clickbait style, here are the *Seven Reasons* why I **REALLY** left Autodesk.

1. [Means](#1-means)
2. [Motive](#2-motive)
3. [Opportunity](#3-opportunity)
4. [The Tim Principle](#4-the-tim-principle)
5. [It's the Organization, Stupid!](#5-its-the-organization-stupid)
6. [The Room Where It Happens](#6-the-room-where-it-happens)
7. [Ever Decreasing Circles](#7-ever-decreasing-circles)

# 1. Means

I left Autodesk because I could. I had the means to do so. 

I've been incredibly lucky in my career. When Autodesk acquired NavisWorks in 2007 I made enough on the deal to be financially comfortable. All my debts cleared, mortgage paid off, plus some to invest.  

Money makes money. 

Autodesk has a great pension scheme where they contribute twice what you do. I could afford the maximum contribution. Some years I added additional voluntary contributions.

Autodesk has a great Employee Share Purchase Scheme. It's effectively a one way bet. The share price is fixed when you join the scheme (it resets every couple of years). Whatever you contribute is saved. Every 6 months it's used to buy shares either at the fixed price (if shares have gone up) or the current price (if shares have gone done). With a 15% discount on top. I could afford the maximum contribution. Most people sell their shares immediately and pocket the profit. I could afford to hold on to them. The financial crisis of 2008 hit shortly after I joined and Autodesk's stock fell to a low of $12. Earlier this year (before the most recent financial crisis) it hit $330. It's now fluctuating around $200.

I had lots of other opportunities to increase my Autodesk stock holding over the years in the form of share options, RSUs and converting annual bonus into stock.

# 2. Motive

I'm now in a position where I don't need to work for financial reasons. In fact, I've never worked for financial reasons (beyond having enough to live on). I've always been motivated by having technically interesting problems to work on. So, the question becomes will it be more technically interesting to work on my own projects or Autodesk's projects? 

What would be more fun?

# 3. Opportunity

So, there was this thing called the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a big deal at the time. The first UK national lock down began in March 2020 and I started working from home for the first time.
