title: How's that blog of yours working out?
---

Thanks for asking. It's been a couple of months since I left Autodesk. I've made a few posts, started to settle into a rhythm. Time to have a look at the analytics and see if anyone is reading this stuff.

When I set the blog up I enabled Google Analytics. I thought briefly about finding something open source or rolling my own and in the end decided that life's too short. Google Analytics is really easy to get started with. Sign up for a free account, grab a snippet of JavaScript and add it to the head section of each page. As I'm [using Jekyll for my blog]({% link _posts/2022-09-21-mac-local-blog-dev.md %}) all I had to do was change my default template. 

For some reason it takes a couple of days before data starts showing up in the console so I wasted some time trying to figure out why it wasn't working. I hadn't done anything wrong. Just needed to wait.

So, what have I learnt?
