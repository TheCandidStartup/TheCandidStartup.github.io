title: Blog Analytics - Six Months In
tags: blog
---

It's been six months since I started the blog. High time to have another look at the analytics. You might want to keep the [previous analytics review]({% link _posts/2022-11-14-blog-analytics.md %}) handy so you can compare and contrast.

I've settled into a cadence of posting weekly on a Monday. That gives me a chance to review whatever I wrote the previous week with fresh eyes and make any final tweaks. I usually have two or three drafts queued up, so haven't found it difficult to keep to the schedule. As I write this, I have 26 posts published, so despite taking a week off at Christmas I'm still on target for 52 posts over the year.

## Users

I've extended the comparison window to a bit over 90 days, so that the preceding period includes the initial flurry of activity when I spammed half of Autodesk with news of my retirement. 

Ouch. That doesn't look too healthy. Last time I had 1500 users over two months, now I'm down to 650 over three months. There are two massive outliers in the first two months data. The first spike is all the people at Autodesk who read my retirement announcement and followed the link to the blog. The second, massive spike, is when my "[Seven Reasons why I REALLY left Autodesk]({% link _posts/2022-10-18-leaving-autodesk.md %})" post went viral (in an understated way) on LinkedIn. The smaller spikes to the right are all aftershocks where someone sparks a new round of sharing. Maybe I should have kept going with the click-bait titles?

What does it look like if I exclude the outliers from those first two months? It's pretty flat. You can't read much into the trends because it really depends on which out of a random pair of blog posts resonated more. Depending on how I change the comparison window, I can get anywhere between a 10% decrease and a 10% increase.

## Demographics

How are those 400 users over the last two months distributed? Similar to last time. A few places have shifted up or down on the chart. Sheffield is now the most represented city. I wonder how many of those are my devices?
