Last time I took you on a tour of the [world's most boring spreadsheet]({% link _posts/2023-01-30-boring-spreadsheet.md %}). I used a basic, if large, spreadsheet to identify some benchmarks that I can use to assess the viability of the crazy implementation ideas we're going to brainstorm. The benchmarks are by no means exhaustive - think of them as the very low bar that any idea needs to get over to be worth considering further.
