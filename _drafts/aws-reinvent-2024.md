* Trying to optimize my investment, find the "good stuff" with as little effort as possible
* [AWS Top Announcements of Reinvent 2024 Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/top-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2024/) has product announcements but nothing about the technical sessions I'm interested in. Also no mention of Aurora DSQL which was my most interesting announcement of Reinvent.
* Official [AWS on-demand sessions](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/on-demand/) is hopeless for finding your way through. Just links to YouTube play lists with lots of sessions missing. Nothing beyond the session title to go on.
* Unofficial [session planners](https://reinvent-planner.cloud/) are far better at letting you filter the catalog to find something interesting, then search for the title on YouTube yourself.
